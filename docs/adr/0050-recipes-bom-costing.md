# 0050 — Recipes/BOM costing, phase A: per-sale ingredient depletion + reporting-only HPP

Status: Accepted (2026-08-09)

## Context

[ADR 0046](0046-ingredient-inventory-phase1.md) shipped ingredient counts (catalog +
receive/adjust + stock opname) and explicitly deferred recipes/BOM. Consequences of that gap,
confirmed by the 2026-08-09 competitive audit (Pawoon, Olsera, majoo, ESB all offer recipe → HPP):

- a costed ingredient's opname variance conflates normal kitchen usage with waste/loss (the
  StocktakeSheet entry hint said exactly this);
- per-dish HPP and menu margin are invisible;
- COGS in the P&L is periodic-approximate (5800 shrinkage only).

Native's differentiator once recipes exist: per-dish HPP that flows into an auditable
double-entry P&L automatically — competitors have either the till or the books, never one ledger.

Owner decisions (2026-08-09): **(1)** full program, phased; **(2)** reporting-only HPP first —
perpetual COGS GL postings in a later phase; **(3)** static latest-cost now (the existing
`ingredient.unit_cost_minor`), moving average when purchasing/receiving lands. Restaurant
vertical only.

## Decision

**New `recipe` feature in restaurant-service** (`id.co.nativeapp.restaurant.recipe`), migration
`V34__recipe_bom.sql`: one table `recipe_line` (Auditable + FORCE RLS, no cross-aggregate FKs —
the `ingredient_stocktake_line` precedent; integrity enforced in `RecipeWriter`):

- `modifier_option_id NULL` discriminates two row shapes: **base line** (`qty_per_portion > 0`
  units consumed per portion) vs **per-option signed delta** (nonzero; "extra cheese" +20 g,
  "no cheese" −20 g), keyed on the modifier option ids that sale lines already snapshot.
- Integer quantities in the ingredient's own unit (ArchUnit decimal ban, ADR 0046 rationale).
  Two partial unique indexes give (item, ingredient[, option]) uniqueness under a nullable
  discriminator.

**Editing = full-replace PUT** (`GET/PUT /api/v1/menu/{itemId}/recipe`, riding the existing
`/api/v1/menu/**` POS_ROLES gateway route). Recipes are small documents edited rarely by one
manager: replace semantics are idempotent, eliminate cross-line lost-update anomalies, and a
concurrent sale sees either the whole old recipe or the whole new one (single transaction),
never a blend. Validation: ingredients exist + active + same outlet; option ids belong to the
item; no duplicate pairs; sign rules (422 `recipe-validation`).

**Per-sale depletion — a separate `IngredientDepletionWriter`** (Propagation.MANDATORY) called
BESIDE `StockDeductionWriter` at every sale-recording site (checkout, payParked, bill checks,
digital capture, offline replay), deliberately NOT wrapped inside it:

- **Failure semantics must never mix.** Menu-item deduction throws on shortfall (the 86 gate);
  ingredient depletion **floors at 0 and never throws for a stock condition** — the dish was
  made, the money is real, the next opname re-establishes truth. Only genuine infrastructure
  failures propagate (rolling back the whole sale — atomicity over availability).
- Per line, each ingredient's net usage = `max(0, base + Σ selected-option deltas)` (a "remove"
  delta can never restock), × line qty, aggregated per ingredient, applied via single-row
  `GREATEST(stock_qty − qty, 0)` UPDATEs in **ascending ingredient-UUID order** (deterministic
  lock order — concurrent sales sharing ingredients cannot deadlock).
- **Split checks deplete per check at payment** — beside the check's own stock deduction,
  behind `BillWriter`'s derived-key idempotency short-circuit, so a replayed check can never
  double-deplete, and (phase C) COGS lands in the same tx/period as that check's revenue.
  Depletion lags physical cooking by design; the opname trues it.
- ONE behavior for online and offline replay (no `AllowingNegative` variant needed — flooring
  already never blocks).

**Reporting-only HPP** (`unitHppMinor` on the recipe response + `GET /api/v1/menu/hpp-summary`):
Σ base-line qty × `unit_cost_minor` — integer arithmetic only, summed over lines whose
`cost_currency` matches the target (lexicographically smallest distinct currency present), with
a completeness flag (`COMPLETE` / `MISSING_COST` / `CURRENCY_MISMATCH`, mismatch takes
precedence). Option deltas are excluded from the headline figure. **No GL impact in this phase**
— finance-service untouched, no new events.

**Consistency guards** (all same-transaction):

- Modifier option/group hard-deletes cascade-delete their recipe deltas via the
  `ModifierOptionCascade` hook (defined in `menu.service`, implemented by
  `recipe.RecipeModifierCascade` — dependency inversion, no menu→recipe import).
- Deactivating an ingredient that any recipe references is vetoed with 409
  `ingredient-in-recipe` via the `IngredientDeactivationGuard` hook (defined in
  `inventory.service`, implemented by `recipe.RecipeIngredientGuard`), naming the referencing
  items.
- Both `menu_item.stock_quantity` deduction AND ingredient depletion run per sale **by design**
  (ADR 0046 decision 2: the 86 gate is untouched) — do not "deduplicate" them.
- No depletion (or, later, COGS) reversal on void/refund: the dish was made; genuine restocks
  surface at the next opname as a 5800 gain.

## Phased roadmap (B and C contracts pinned; ordering is load-bearing)

- **Phase B — purchasing + capitalization + moving average.** Receive-with-cost extends
  `/stock/add` (moving-average update of `unit_cost_minor`), `goods_receipt` audit table (V35),
  new event `IngredientsReceived {receipt_id, company_id, business_id, ingredient_id, qty,
  received_at, value_minor, currency}` → finance posts **Dr 1100 Inventory / Cr 2050 GRNI
  Clearing** (new LIABILITY account + role, the 1900/1901/1902 clearing idiom applied to the
  receipt-vs-bill timing split), AND AP bills gain a per-line inventory flag posting **Dr 2050**
  instead of 5000 — both halves ship in the SAME release (else GRNI grows forever or purchases
  double-count).
- **Phase C — perpetual COGS.** `IngredientDepletionWriter` folds COGS from the same query
  (snapshot at sale time, current unit costs), persisted as `sale.cogs_minor`+`cogs_currency`
  (audit anchor — recipes mutate under full-replace) and emitted as a separate
  `SaleCogsRecorded {sale_id, company_id, business_id, occurred_at, cogs_minor, currency}`
  event (avoiding the SALE posting-template deployment hazard, V37 note) → finance posts
  **Dr 5100 COGS (HPP) / Cr 1100** + P&L read models, with the sealed-period quarantine.
- **B MUST precede C.** Perpetual COGS credits 1100 on every sale; until purchases capitalize
  (debit) 1100, the account goes monotonically negative AND food cost double-counts (purchase
  in 5000 + COGS in 5100). Phase C's finance migration must repeat this invariant.
- **Phase D (named only).** Ingredient-derived availability, waste entries with reasons,
  per-line COGS + menu-engineering dashboard, recipe versioning (`If-Match`).

## Consequences

- After recipes cover a menu, a costed ingredient's opname variance reads as **waste/variance**,
  not normal usage (console copy updated); until phase C the GL still books it all through 5800
  at opname time (periodic), so total expense is unchanged — only its visibility improves.
- HPP is only as good as ingredient costs: uncosted or foreign-currency lines are excluded and
  flagged, never guessed. Very cheap per-gram ingredients whose true unit cost rounds below one
  minor unit distort HPP — the console recommends pcs/pack units for those (documented, not
  engineered around; IDR's zero minor exponent makes per-g costing exact for typical staples).
- Depletion adds one aggregate SELECT + ≤ (distinct ingredients) single-row UPDATEs to the
  checkout hot path, lock-ordered; measured as negligible next to the existing writes.
- Carwash/barbershop verticals are untouched (no ingredient model).
